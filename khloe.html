        Vico Sotto named ‘anti-corruption champion’ by US state department
        
        <p>MANILA, Philippines — Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto has been recognized by 
        <br>the US Department of State as one of its 12 International Anticorruption Champions.
        <br>In a statement on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the 
        <br>International Anti-corruption Champion Award aims to recognize individuals 
        <br>“who have worked tirelessly, often in the face of adversity, to defend 
        <br>transparency, combat corruption, and ensure accountability in their own countries.”

        <p>The state department, in a separate statement, said the award aims to “recognize 
        <br>individuals who have demonstrated leadership, courage, and impact in preventing, exposing, and combating corruption.”
        <br>The US body described Sotto as a “standard-bearer for a new generation of Philippine politicians
        <br> who prioritize anticorruption and transparency initiatives in their election campaigns and in office.”

        <p>“In 2019, Sotto, then a 29-year-old city councilor, defeated an incumbent mayor 
        <br>whose family had ruled the city for 27 years. Sotto’s prior work on the city council 
        <br>resulted in freedom of information legislation that allowed city residents to request documents
        <br>without having to provide a justification – the first such law in the Metro Manila area,” the statement read.

        <p>“Sotto has sought to solidify his reputation as a fresh voice with a new, more transparent approach to governance,” it added.
        <br>In recognizing Sotto, the US Department of State also noted that he has pledged to avoid kickbacks in the awarding of city contracts, established a 24/7 public 
        <br>information and complaints hotline, and formally involved civil society organizations in the city’s budgeting and policy making.

        <br>It added that the young mayor has also mandated that the value of all city 
        <br>government contracts be reduced by at least 10 percent, a move intended to reduce bribery in the awarding of contracts.
