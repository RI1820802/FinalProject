        ISSUE OF ECONOMIC DRAG

        COVID-19 Continues to Batter the Philippines, Indonesia

        
        <p>Late January brought the news that the Philippine economy had contracted by 
            <br>nearly a tenth in 2020, as the aftereffects of COVID-19 began to force 
            <br>themselves upon the government of President Rodrigo Duterte. According to 
            <br>figures released by the Philippine Statistical Authority, full-year GDP growth 
            <br>was minus 9.5 percent, the worst economic contraction on record.
        <p>The glimmer of good news was that the slump eased off in the last quarter of the 
            <br>year, shrinking 8.3 percent from a year earlier, largely due to higher government 
            <br>spending, following a 11.4 percent contraction in the third quarter. But the yearly
             <br>recession is the country’s worst in nearly three decades, and suggests that the 
             <br>economic aftereffect of COVID-19 could drag on through the coming year. As of 
             <br>February 2, the Philippines had recorded a total of 528,853 confirmed 
             <br>coronavirus infections and 10,874 deaths from the disease.
        <p>The only nation that has fared worse is Indonesia, which late last month passed 1 
            <br>million confirmed positive cases, becoming the 19th country to reach the 
            <br>melancholy milestone, and the first in Southeast Asia.
        <p>The economic effects of COVID-19 on Indonesia have been less severe than in 
            <br>the Philippines – the World Bank projects the country’s GDP to contract by just 
            <br>2.2 percent in 2020 – but its public health impacts have been markedly worse. 
            <br>Where Manila has mostly managed to prevent the uptick in cases, last month was the most deadly for COVID-19 in Indonesia.
        <p>In fact, it’s probably much worse. Given the fact that Indonesia’s testing rate is 
            <br>one of the lowest in the world among those countries most affected by COVID-19, 
            <br>the real case load could be up to 10 times higher, according to some experts. 
            <br>Indonesia’s death toll from COVID-19 (30,277 as of February 1) is more than 
            <br>that of all other Southeast Asian countries combined.
