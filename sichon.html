        Philippines to receive first COVID-19 vaccines, start inoculations next week
        
        <p>MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines will take delivery of its first COVID-19 vaccines at the weekend, 
        <br>allowing it to kick off its inoculation programme from next week, a senior official said on Thursday.
        <p>Despite having among the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Asia, 
        <br>the Philippines will be the last Southeast Asian country to receive its initial set of vaccines.
        <p>The delivery of 600,000 doses Sinovac Biotech’s vaccines, donated by China,
        <br> will arrive on Sunday, said Harry Roque, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte.
        <p>“It rolls out on Monday because our countrymen are excited,” 
        <br>he said of the vaccination programme.
        <p>Among the first to be inoculated will be an official from 
        <br>a hospital who lost both parents to the coronavirus, plus a tricycle driver, Roque said.
        <p>The Philippines has ordered 25 million doses from Sinovac and was supposed to receive its first batch on Feb. 23. 
        <br>That was delayed emergency use authorisation was only given this week.
        <p>Aside from Sinovac, 10,000 doses of a vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm will arrive soon, 
        <br>under a “compassionate use” for Duterte’s security detail. Doses from AstraZeneca will arrive in March, Roque said.
        <p>“I have to admit, if we insisted on Western brands, we will still wait for its arrival,” he added.
        <p>Duterte, who has pursued warmer ties with China and has a strained relationship with many Western countries,
        <br> has previously said he wanted to procure COVID-19 vaccines from China or Russia.
        <p>The vaccination programme will be crucial for Philippine efforts to revive its economy, 
        <br>which suffered a record 9.5% slump last year due to strict and lengthy lockdowns that hit consumer spending and saw big job losses.
