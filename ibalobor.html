        Commonwealth shooting a ‘misencounter’ between PNP and PDEA; 2 die – police

        <p>MANILA, Philippines — A shooting incident that occurred near a mall along 
        <br>Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City early Wednesday evening appeared to
        <br>be a “misencounter” between operatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP) 
        <br>and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). Two persons were killed.
        <br>According to Metro Manila police chief Major Gen. Vicente Danao, the two 
        <br>individuals killed were policemen while four others – a police officer and three PDEA operatives – were “badly injured.”
        <br>“We have a very unfortunate incident that happened at [6:30] p.m. This is a 
        <br>legitimate operation on both sides coming from PDEA and Drug Enforcement 
        <br>Unit of QCPD. A very unfortunate incident that happened. Whoever is at fault 
        <br>and whatever the reason will still be investigated,” Danao, speaking parlty in Filipino, told reporters.
        <br>“Initially, we have two coming from the PNP who were killed and one who is badly injured, and I just don’t know about the side of PDEA. I think three were from 
        <br>PDEA. I don’t know if there were killed. They’re still at the hospital,” he added.

        <p>Based on a “Sketchy Incident Report ” of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) 
        <br>Station 6 in Batasan Hills, QCPD’s District Special Operations Unit (DSOU) 
        <br>launched a buy-bust operation near the Ever Gotesco Mall. This report was 
        <br>confirmed to INQUIRER.net by a QCPD Station 6 personnel, who requested anonymity, during a follow-up phone interview.
        <br>Unknown to the DSOU operatives, they were transacting with PDEA’s Special 
        <br>Enforcement Service (SES) agents.
        <br>“QCPD-DSOU personnel conducted a buy-bust operation with complete 
        <br>coordinations and necessary papers. However, during the buy-bust operation the 
        <br>PNP personnel involved (did not know that) [..] the people they were transacting are PDEA Agents,” QCPD’s Station 6 said in the report.
        <br>“Allegedly during the (confrontation), PDEA agents first engaged to shot (sic) 
        <br>towards the PNP personnel, leaving no option [for police but] to fight back… 
        <br>[and which] resulted [in] series of injuries (sic) to both parties,” it added.

        <p>Earlier, PDEA spokesperson Director Derrick Carreon said their SES was conducting a legitimate anti-drug operation near the mall.
        <br>“As of this moment, only one thing is clear— that the PDEA Special 
        <br>Enforcement Service was there on a legitimate operation,” Carreon told reporters.
