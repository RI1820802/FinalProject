        The ‘mañanita effect’

        <p>In April 2020, Dominic Cummings, adviser to the British prime minister, 
        <br>became embroiled in a public scandal: He appeared to have broken lockdown rules by traveling 
        <br>264 miles with his wife to stay at a property near his parents’, at a time when
        <br>nonessential travel had been banned. What followed was an affair of public outrage and internet memes,
        <br>as Cummings and his supporters quibbled over the ethics and legality 
        <br>of his actions. At the time, I kept up with the issue over UK public radio, curious as 
        <br>to how government would react and whether the United Kingdom would
        <br>handle such matters with alacrity and force. As it turns out, the answer was no. 
        <br>For context, other public figures who broke lockdown rules later apologized and resigned. 
        <br>Cummings did not. The prime minister even stood by his adviser’s actions,
        <br>claiming that the latter had acted “responsibly, legally and with integrity.” This led to what was later
        <br>known as “the Cummings effect”: The loss of public trust that followed, thanks to Cummings’ 
        <br>actions and the government’s responses having undermined the messaging to stay home. 
        <br>The Cummings effect has been cited as a factor contributing to the state of the United Kingdom’s coronavirus response, 
        <br>as case numbers soared higher while crowds were repeatedly photographed in beaches and pubs. 
        <br>It emphasized how much government messaging, as well as the actions of public figures, 
        <br>affects compliance to coronavirus restrictions.
